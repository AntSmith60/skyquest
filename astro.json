This places midnight at the center of our inquiries, since astronomers are implicitly night-owls. Also note, 24hrs from noon may or may not be noon on the following day, since we display local times along with the vagueries of daylight saving.\n\n- Days are divided into, at most, 9 bands of daytime, night-time, dawns and dusks (civil, nautical, astronomical). Never more than 9 (the sun only rises once per day).\n\n\n\nNote that we have imported QWidget from the continuum in its own (alien) metaphor. We allow that metaphor (of layouts, labels and fonts) to pervade here out of kindness to the sanity of others reading this module... but the underlying data concepts and exposures are within our chrono-mytho metaphor; as you will see.",

Multiple daily views can be stacked. The x-axis shows the local time of day, sensitive to daylight saving time. When showing multiple days, the x-axis reflects the last day drawn. The y-axis sets the plotted altitude range.\n\n\n\nDaylight bands can also be shown which segment the day (through coloured background blocks) between day and night, along with the various periods of twilight and dawn (civil, nautical and astronmical) - which is again true to the last day plotted.\n\n\n\nCelestial bodies can be selected for the plot, with the lunar arc, also, always available. The lunar arc is plotted in grey, at a brightness dictated by the moon-illumination on each plotted hour. The transit arcs of chosen objects are plotted with a degree of transparency dictated by the moon-illumination - i.e indicating how visible such onjects _may_ be (of course that's also a question of altitude and weather)\n\n\n\nIt is therefore possible to see the optimum time to observe specific objects in the night sky with regards daylight level, moon-illumination and altitude - for one or more days; from anywhere in the world. The current dataset (from skyfield) is good to just before John Lennon's 113th birthday; so that'll need an update at some point...\n\n\n\nOnce a plot has been created, it can be animated. Basically this clears the chart and re-draws it on an hour-by-hour and day-by-day basis; optionally generating a video file. SkyQuest maintains 2 views on the data: that which renders the overall plot in its entirety, and; that which renders the plot as a sequenced animation. This supports fast visibility toggling of aspects of the plot (e.g. turning the lunar arc on or off), and also allows those aspects to be excluded from the (reccorded) animation. The animation can proceed either:\n\n- To the full accccumulation of the plot, or\n\n- as a sliding time window across the full day-range of the plot; e.g. to show a full monthly cycle changing across a year\n\n\n\nSkyQuest is well aware of just what it IS. There are a number of founding principals woven inherently into the source-code. You might want to argue that I should have been more absract in my modelling, to make the code more (re)useful; I'd counter, you know, life is finite.  Anyways, so we are clear:\n\n\n\n- SkyQuest shows a (possibly stacked) day-by-day view, with a 'day' being the 24h hour period that follows noon on a given date.\n\n- Altitudes (and illumation) of objects are plotted to an hourly resolution.\n\n- Events (sunrise, onset of astronomical twilight, etc...) are plotted to a minute resolution.\n\n- There are 9 such events in a day\n\n- Video is output in HD resolution at 50fps - i.e. at a rate of 2 full animated days per second.\n\n\n\nIn-code, SkyQuest is presented as a cast of ancient greek mythological figures and concepts. Time is presented as both its fundamental material (Chronos) and its working mechanics (Kairos) with some influence of the fates (Moirai) also. Tiphys (helmsman of the Argonauts) provides the navigational support by caring for our home base vantage and our destination (selected celestial bodies).

All that matters to us is the daylight level: true night, astronomical twilight, nautical twilght, etc.. whichever end of the day we find those levels.\n\nLogically speaking we get 9 of these per day. We can cope with fewer (like we might see near the poles) but we have a deeply grounded faith that no day (24 hour period) will see the sun rise twice. I think that's reasonable.",
